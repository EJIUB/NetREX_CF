# NetREX_CF

We introduce  NetREX_CF -- Regulatory **Net**work **R**econstruction using **EX**pression and **C**ollaborative **F**iltering -- a GRN reconstruction approach that brings together a modern machine learning strategy (Collaborative Filtering) 
to address the incompleteness of the prior knowledge 
and a biologically justified model of gene expression (sparse Network Component Analysis based model).
